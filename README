USAGE:

Include the class:

	include('use0mk.class.php');

Create an object for the class:

	$use0mk = new use0mk();

If you want to login to the service add your username and apikey as parameters
when you're creating the object.

	example:
	$use0mk = new use0mk("0mkapi", "1a7854a2226925282e54d1a01af5058c");


Actions:

- Shortening long link:

	example:
	$use0mk->shortenUrl("http://google.com/");
	
	If the shortening is sucessful the function will return the short link.
	If not, you'll get the same link that you inserted.
	
- Previewing short link:

	example:
	$use0mk->previewUrl("http://0.mk/example");
	
	If the link is valid and exists in the database the function will return the 
	short link.
	If not, you'll get the same link that you inserted.
	
- Shortening all long links in a string:

	example:
	$use0mk->shortenAll("Links in string: http://google.com/ http://yahoo.com");
	
	All links in the inserted string will be sent for shortening and the old long
	links will be replaced with the new short ones. 
	If shortening of some of the links is unsucessful, this link won't be replaced.
